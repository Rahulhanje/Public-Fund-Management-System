üìå High-Level Overview

This contract (PublicFundManagement) is a decentralized public fund allocation system.

Authorities (trusted people/entities) can create proposals for funding.

Authorities vote first, and if they approve, the proposal goes to public voting.

The public (via SBT holders) votes on whether the proposal should get funded.

Once approved, funds are released to the recipient in stages (milestones), with authority oversight.

The contract is controlled by an admin who can deposit/withdraw funds and manage authorities.

Basically, it‚Äôs like a DAO-driven public funding system with staged payouts.

‚öôÔ∏è Key Components
1. Roles

Admin

Deploys contract, sets SBT contract, manages funds, manages authorities.

Authorities

Trusted addresses added by admin.

Can create proposals and vote on them + stage reports.

Public (SBT holders)

Anyone who owns a Soulbound Token (SBT) can vote on proposals.

One vote per SBT token.

2. Proposal Lifecycle

Each proposal goes through these states:

Created ‚Üí Authority proposes a project.

UnderAuthorityVoting ‚Üí Authorities vote yes/no.

PublicVoting ‚Üí Public (SBT holders) votes for 7 days.

Approved / Rejected ‚Üí Based on votes.

InProgress ‚Üí Funds released stage by stage.

Completed ‚Üí When all stages are done.

3. Stages (Milestones)

Each proposal can have 1‚Äì3 stages.

Each stage has:

Allocated amount of funds.

Report submitted by the recipient.

Authority approval votes on the report.

Funds for each stage are released only after completion.

4. Funds

Admin deposits ETH into contract (depositFunds).

Admin can withdraw unused funds in emergencies (withdrawFunds).

Funds are transferred to proposal recipients in stages after approvals.

5. Voting

Authorities:

Vote yes/no on proposals and stage reports.

Majority (>50%) required to move forward.

Public (SBT holders):

Each SBT token = 1 vote.

Prevents double-voting by tracking token IDs.

Votes include an optional comment.

‚ö†Ô∏è Potential Issues & Risks

Centralized admin power

Admin can withdraw funds anytime ‚Üí risk of rugpull if not trusted.

Admin also controls authority list.

Voting checks

closePublicVoting() doesn‚Äôt enforce publicVotingEndTime (commented out).

Admin can close voting early.

Stage fund release

Admin manually triggers stage fund release; could delay payments unfairly.

Scalability

Uses mappings inside structs (stages, hasTokenVoted), which makes iterating proposals off-chain harder.

SBT dependency

Relies entirely on an external SBT contract for voter identity.

‚úÖ In short:
This is a public funding + milestone release system where:

Admin manages funds & authorities.

Authorities create proposals, vote, and oversee reports.

The public (via SBT) votes to approve/reject proposals.

Funds are released in stages after authority approval.
